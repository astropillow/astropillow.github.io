# Questions:
- Why dedicate a ministry spot to AI
- Why it makes sense to tackle at the government level. internal/external.

# Essay
Here is a sign that artificial intelligence is not a niche subject: Starting in 2025, Canada will have its first minister of artificial intelligence. The role is newly created and stands out from the typical ministry names. On the surface, this may seem like a hype, but it is ultimately the continuation of longstanding government focus on industry, technology, and the embrace of digital innovation. The question becomes, *why put a spotlight on artificial intelligence at the government level?*

One of the biggest technological developments that have marked the years 2020-2025 is generative artificial intelligence. In parallel, the same hardware and software optimizations that generate artificial poetry and paintings, has also allowed leaps in other applications of machine learning. These effects of this boom in artificial intelligence, while hyped by some and dismissed by others, will be somewhere in the middle. The uptake in the use of artificial intelligence will see disruption to a wide variety of industries, with both positive and negative consequences.
